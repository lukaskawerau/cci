# Career Capital Inventory

Following the advice of [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/) and [Scott H. Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2017/07/17/lesson-1-capital-trumps-courage/) I'm building an inventory of career capital.
For me personally, that means primarily Political Science and Programming/Data Science skills, but I'll happily accept pull requests for other fields as well.

## Structure:  
One file per "field" (i.e. polisci.md, data_science.md, etc.)  
Skill with descriptions for 10/10, 5/10 ranks.

Here's Cal's description of how to do it:
"List every professional skill/ability for which your current competency is above the absolute beginner level. 
For each such skill, come up with a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 corresponds to absolute beginner, and 10 corresponds to the super star level. Make this scale concrete by stating specifically what it would mean to be at 10, and perhaps, what it would mean to be square in the middle with a score of 5."

## Benefits:
"This exercise provides a useful quantitative inventory of your existing career capital. You can use this inventory in several ways. 

For example, the inventory provides a reality check on just how valuable you actually are to the market at the moment. If your list is sparse, and/or contains only low scores, then this evidence should motivate you to turn your attention away from dreams of short-term courageous career transformations, and focus instead on building up the capital that makes real transformations possible. 

In addition, it provides numbers that you can strive to improve. The vague intention to “work hard” doesn’t always return many rewards. But a much more focused attempt to improve your skill score from 3 to 5 for a given target will likely be a much more productive use of the same effort.

It can also help you confirm that you’re taking the most advantage of the things you’re already good at. If you score high on a skill that’s not being used much in your current position, make a change to correct this problem. Take on new projects or responsibilities that more directly leverage the skill."

This is part of Cal and Scott's ["Top Performer" course](http://top-performer-course.com/waitinglist.html), which you should check out.
I neither affiliated nor a member, but it looks really good and the two are really good at what they do, so it might be interesting for anyone stumbling on this.

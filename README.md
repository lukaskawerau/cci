# Career Capital Inventory

Following the advice of [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/) I'm building an inventory of career capital.
For me personally, that means primarily Political Science and Programming/Data Science skills, but I'll happily accept pull requests for other fields as well.

Structure:  
One file per "field" (i.e. polisci.md, data_science.md, etc.)
Skill with descriptions for 10/10, 5/10 ranks.

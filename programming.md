# CCI for Programming/Development

> This is like a super big tent and I'm not sure it makes sense to pick a "field" this broad, but oh well better than nothing  
> These are currently lifted from Zed Shaw's [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/887345112086437893) to the following question: "Give me a skill you wish Junior Developers had, but that are needed on every platform and in every language. Not "React", or "OO Design".

## Description
"List every professional skill/ability for which your current competency is above the absolute beginner level.  
For each such skill, come up with a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 corresponds to absolute beginner, and 10 corresponds to the super star level.  
Make this scale concrete by stating specifically what it would mean to be at 10, and perhaps, what it would mean to be square in the middle with a score of 5."

> The current list would actually fall into Lvl 5 for the general ability to "programm", because that is what Zed asked. In listing these,
do I still follow the spirit of the exercise or am I too granular?
